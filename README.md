## Preface and Introduction
Hello everyone, I'm Gu Wenjing, this is my first personal project in the m1 stage and my first independently developed game.  
For this work, my ability to use code and operate scratch software is also very limited. This is the best I can do so far.  
The game is a quiz game with the aim of deepening mutual understanding between peoples of different countries to reduce cultural gaps. Because I experienced a lot of cultural shock when I first came to France and tried to solve it in my own way. From my own experience, I wanted to help more students, so I made this game.
## Players
A French and a Chinese
## How to play
Two people who play the game answer questions about each other's country and culture, and learn about each other's culture. And this game can also provide some topics for players to talk to. Because I found in my previous experience that there are many silent moments and ice-breaking moments when speaking, the small game software I designed can solve this problem very well. Also, you can learn languages in the game.
## Game flow
First, the first player chooses his gender, avatar, name and nationality.

Then the second player chooses. Once selected, the game starts. The two players take turns to answer.

After each answer, you can not rush to the next question. You can discuss with each other based on this question and explain the reason. And it may also diffract some other interesting topics that can be chatted. Answering questions is not the most important thing, happy communication is the purpose of this game.   
At the end of the game, you can see your respective correct rates, as well as the final winner.
