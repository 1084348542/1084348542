## Preface and Introduction
Hello everyone, I'm Gu Wenjing, this is my first personal project in the m1 stage and my first independently developed game.  
For this work, my ability to use code and operate scratch software is also very limited. This is the best I can do so far.  
The game is a quiz game with the aim of deepening mutual understanding between peoples of different countries to reduce cultural gaps. Because I experienced a lot of cultural shock when I first came to France and tried to solve it in my own way. From my own experience, I wanted to help more students, so I made this game.
